The new UI should be able to display what the currently connect node contains in data like
It's Pull Conections each connection is create from a template. 

There should also be a better menu to select a item to build with. Maybe do that in a adative scene so it is alway setup correctly and perhaps it could use 3d moddels like 
clasic sims ish style build screen or soemthing... not sure what do to but it will be some sort of drop down or a selection bar on wich the player can select a new object.

The indicator might need a rework too to make it look better. 

background rework needed too change it from a plane with a texture to line renders so it can look better.
